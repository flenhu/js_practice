# Lesson 6 Exercises - Booleans and If-Statements

**6a.** Create a variable called 'hour' and save the current hour of the day (use 24-hour format and save it as a number between 0 and 23).
- If hour is between 6 and 12, display 'Good morning!' in the console
- If hour is between 13 and 17, display 'Good afternoon!' in the console
- Otherwise, display 'Good night!' in the console

**6b.** Continuing from 6a, try changing the value in the 'hour' variable to make it display different messages.

**6c.** Continuing from 6a, create a variable called 'name' and save your name inside (as a string). Update the if-statement to display your name in each message. For example: 'Good morning $(name}!'
